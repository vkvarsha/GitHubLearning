	/* How JAVA Internally Works
	 * Operating system understand only Binary language that is 0 ,1 
	 * 
	 *Class extension is .java which understand by Human,
	 *Java file  get compile  --- we get compile time errorj due to syntax issue and rule
	 *it get save into src folder
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * Compilation --> Trnaslate .java file into .class file.
	 * .class file is intermediate file
	 * .class file is neither understand by human and nor understand by operating system
	 * class file saved into bin folder * 
	 * Right click on class, click on property, there will be a path of class file
	 
	 
	 
	 
	 * On pass the Interpretation it will convert into binary file
	 * if fail it gives run time error
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Binary file is the input for Operating system and it convert into output
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * For Complie .java file is the Input and on compilation the output is .class file
	 * For Interpretation .class file is the input and on interpret the output is binary file
	 * In Interpretation read line by line
	 * Interpretation checks for  -- jdk,jre,jvm,jit
	 * 
	 * JDK -- Java Development Kits (These are the library files that are require to run the programme
	 * 
	 * jre -- Java run time enviornment (it provide the enviornment to run the java programme)
	 * if jre not present in the device , we cannot run the programme
	 * it get installed with eclipse
	 * 
	 * 
	 * jvm - java virtual machine -- it is only responsible for the execution of code starting from the main method  psvm
	 * it is not present physically but it is present virtually
	 * 
	 * jit -- just in time  . It is responsible for to convert .class file into binary file
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	
	 * Code means .java file is human language but operating system does not understand
	 * Hence it require compilation and interpretation
	 * Input to compilation is .java file , compilation check syntax and java rule. if fail it will get compilation error
	 * Compilation will convert .java file to .class file
	 * .class file is intermediate file which does not understand by human nor by operating system
	 * .class file is input for interpretation. it read code line by line, and check logical . 
	 * On pass ,it convert .class file to binary file.
	 * On fail it gives exception
	 * interpretation require jdk - library file repsonsible to run the programme, jvm - not physicall present but responsible 
	 * to run programe from main method
	 * jre -- enviornment to run the programme, jit -- responsible to convert binary file into output
	 * 
	 *
